# Memento Tattoo 

Hello everyone, 

During my apprenticeship, I did not have the opportunity to do many projects only in javascript. That is why I am currently carrying out this project, MementoTattoo, a project that is close to my heart and that concerns one of my passions, tattooing. 

The objective of this project is to provide a database of all the traditional U.S tattoos that exist to date and to provide historical explanations to it. 

I found that the old-school universe is particularly discreet about the meaning of different tattoos, We can see that some motives come up regularly and I find it really rewarding to allow people to discover the stories surrounding each of them.
